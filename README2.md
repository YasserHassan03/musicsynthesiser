# Initiation Interval, Execution Time, and Critical Instant Analysis

In this discussion, we delve into the concepts of Critical Instant Analysis (CIA), CPU utilization, and task execution time.

# Python CIA Script
To perform CIA analysis, we've developed a Python script named `cia.py`. This script organizes tasks into Task objects, each comprising the task's execution time and its period or initiation interval. This setup proves invaluable, especially when determining worst-case execution times for individual tasks.

Upon supplying properly structured Task objects to the critical_instant_analysis() function, the script arranges them by priority. Priority is inversely proportional to the period (larger period implies higher priority). Subsequently, the script identifies the task with the longest period and stores it as response_time. Then, it calculates the total execution time for each task within one period of the task with the lowest priority. This calculation ensures that we consider the ceiling value when determining the number of task iterations. Finally, a comparison between the total execution time and the period of the lowest priority task determines whether the tasks are schedulable, and this outcome is conveyed through a print statement.

# Computing CPU Utilization
Within the same `cia.py` script, we compute CPU utilization by iterating through all tasks, dividing their execution time by their period, and summing these values. This sum is then converted into a percentage and printed for easy understanding.
